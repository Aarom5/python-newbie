# python-newbie
Home to some new python projects and simple code.
This repository was just created for me to practice some python code and at the same time to do some projects. I am learning Python from Coursera's-Python for Everybody Specialization. As I learn, I test the code and post it here. Feel free to have a look. The file names look confusing enough so apologies for that.
